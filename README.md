# HOMEWORK 2: RESPONSIVE PORTFOLIO

In this homework assignment, I have created a responsive portfolio.My site consists of 3 files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`. Each of the files has the same template including the nav bar and additional styling. The fixed navbar includes an image, along with the links for the "About Me", "Portfolio", and "Contact" pages. The navbar also has a collapsable menu to accommodate a smaller screen. 


## Index

My `index.html` file includes my "About Me" section. In this file, I used Bootstrap to make a card including my information. At the top of the card, I have a card header, followed by a picture of me in the card body, then I included the description about me in the card footer.


## Portfolio

My `portfolio.html` file includes the different elements inside my portfolio. As of right now, I don't have any actula elements to include, so I have included 3 placeholders. As far as the design, I have included 3 smaller cards that are inside of one larger card. Each of the cards is formatted similarly, with a card header, and a card body. The cards inside of the smaller card contain different pictures of me.


## Contact

My `contact.html` file includes all of my contact information, as well as my social media information. In this file, I have one larger card, which has card list groups showing my information for: Gmail, Facebook, Github, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Each of these list elements contain links to my github and social media pages. I then inserted a card footer which contains pictures of each of those elements of the list, which are also links to my respective pages.
